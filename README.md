# The AI Collaboration Playbook: Strategic Case Studies in Prompt Engineering

### Introduction

This repository is not just a list of prompt "hacks." It's a collection of strategic **Case Studies** that document the real-world process of collaborating with Large Language Models to solve complex problems.

The core philosophy of this playbook is **The Retrospective Method**. Each case study analyzes a project through two lenses:
1.  **The Actual Path:** The real, iterative, and often inefficient journey of discovery.
2.  **The Optimized Path:** The ideal, strategic path that hindsight and prompting design patterns reveal.

By comparing these two paths, we can distill reusable patterns and build a more strategic approach to working with AI. This repository is a living document of that learning process.

### How to Use This Playbook

Each folder in the `/case-studies/` directory is a self-contained analysis of a single project. The best place to start is with our foundational framework:

*   **[The Retrospective Method: A Framework for Strategic Prompting](./case_studies/00_the_retrospective_method.md)**

### Table of Contents

*   **Case Studies**
    *   **[Case Study 01: Designing a Personal Knowledge Management System](./case_studies/01_designing_a_knowledge_system.md)**
    *   *(More case studies will be added here)*

### Contributing

Feedback, suggestions, and new case study ideas are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss.
