# The Retrospective Method: A Framework for Strategic Prompting

## The Core Idea

The quality of an AI's output is not just about the final prompt; it's about the entire strategic process. The **Retrospective Method** is a framework for analyzing our AI collaborations to improve that process.

It involves a structured comparison of two approaches:

1.  **The Actual Path (Evolutionary):** This is the journey we often takeâ€”a series of iterative, reactive prompts. We solve one problem, which reveals another, and we proceed step-by-step. While effective, it can be slow and inefficient.
2.  **The Optimized Path (Goal-Oriented):** This is the ideal journey we can construct with hindsight. It uses a small number of highly-strategic prompts that define the end goal from the beginning.

The goal of this repository is to learn from the "Actual Path" to better understand how to construct an "Optimized Path" in the future.

## The Prompting Design Patterns Toolbox

The Optimized Path is built using a set of reusable strategies, or "Design Patterns." These are the tools we use to craft powerful, strategic prompts.

### Phase 1: Framing & Scoping
*   **The Blueprint Pattern:** Describing the final destination, not just the next step.
*   **The Layered Abstraction Pattern:** Moving from "Why" (strategy) to "How" (tactics) to "What" (details) in separate prompts.

### Phase 2: Optimization
*   **The Prompt Optimizer Pattern:** Asking the AI to critique and improve your own draft prompt before execution.

### Phase 3: Instruction & Context
*   **The Persona Pattern:** Assigning the AI a specific role or expertise.
*   **The Few-Shot Pattern:** Providing 2-3 examples to show the desired output format.
*   **The Chain of Thought (CoT) Pattern:** Instructing the model to "think step-by-step" to improve logical reasoning.

### Phase 4: Refinement & Verification
*   **The Self-Critique Pattern:** Asking the AI to review its own output against a new set of criteria.

The following case studies will use this framework to analyze real-world examples.
